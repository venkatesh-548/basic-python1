The beans are ground and soaked in water, which releases their flavor, color, caffeine content, and nutrients. Although coffee is often served hot, it can also be served iced.
        In many countries, including the United States, coffee is typically enjoyed with breakfast. It’s favored in the mornings because its caffeine content offers stimulating effects that may help people feel more awake (1Trusted Source). 
        Many people add creamer, milk, half-and-half, sugar, or sweetener to their coffee to make it creamy, reduce the bitter flavor, or both. Black coffee is also used as the base of many drinks, including cappuccinos, lattes, and macchiatos.</p></div>

This is especially the case because of the latte art decorations that are often drawn into the steamed milk foam.
        This popular drink is made by layering a balanced ratio of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam in that order. This is to ensure the cappuccinos’ bold and rich flavors, as well as to maintain its thick, foamy texture. It is common to add flavored syrups and other toppings, such as chocolate powder, to further sweeten the deal.
        Popular flavored syrups are caramel, chocolate, and vanilla, but the possibilities are not limited to these three. </p></div>

Affogato is actually a dessert that is meant to either be slowly sipped or enjoyed with a spoon. It is typically made with vanilla gelato or ice cream as the primary dessert and completed with a shot of hot espresso.
        It is a coffee lover’s all-in-one after-dinner drink, coffee, and dessert. Because its base is the dessert, it is considered a cold brew, though arguments can be made that it is a hot brew because the shot of espresso is technically hot.
        Affogatos balance the beloved rich and toasty taste of espresso with the creamy sweetness of the chosen dessert. The ice cream is usually a choice of vanilla, caramel, or mocha. If you choose to use a gelato instead, you will usually see vanilla or hazelnut. In some instances, you could also find versions of affogatos to have a shot of alcohol, such as amaretto or Bicerin.
